## vrr.refresh_departures

      - delay:
          seconds: 2
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Next Departure"
          message: >
            {{ states('sensor.vrr_dusseldorf_hauptbahnhof') }} -
            {{ state_attr('sensor.vrr_dusseldorf_hauptbahnhof', 'next_departure_minutes') }} min
```

### Rate Limiting Considerations

!!! warning
    While the refresh service bypasses the normal update interval, it still counts against the daily API rate limit.

- Each refresh counts as one API call
- The integration tracks daily API calls
- If the rate limit is reached, refreshes will fail
- A repair issue will be created if rate limiting is triggered

### Best Practices

1. **Don't call too frequently** - Give time for API response before triggering again
2. **Use in specific scenarios** - Arriving home, before leaving, etc.
3. **Combine with normal updates** - Don't rely solely on manual refreshes
4. **Monitor API usage** - Check the diagnostics for call counts
